## SDAP

SDAP (Science Data Analytic Platform) provides earth observation data access and computing as scalable services.

SDAP has been incubating since 2017-10-22.

### Three most important unfinished issues to address before graduating:


1. Make official SDAP (Incubating) Release
2. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
3. Automated testing


### Are there any issues that the IPMC or ASF Board need to be aware of?

NONE


### How has the community developed since the last report?

7 active developers have committed on the project during the reporting period (since November 2021).

 ### How would you assess the podling's maturity?
Please feel free to add your own commentary.

  - [x] Initial setup
  - [x] Working towards first release
  - [x] Community building
  - [x] Nearing graduation
  - [ ] Other:

### Date of last release:

  2022-06-22 (webapp component version 0.4.5a46)

### When were the last committers or PPMC members elected?

*******TO BE COMPLETED*******


### Have your mentors been helpful and responsive?

The application development has been responsive. The mentors are helpful and responsive in our developers community.

We now also have monthly meetings to coordinate and inform on the stakeholders using SDAP for multiple projects.

We had difficulties to report regularly on our activity but we set an organization so that it is now a rolling responsibility shared in the team.


### Is the PPMC managing the podling's brand / trademarks?

******* I don't know what this is about********

Are 3rd parties respecting and correctly using the podlings
name and brand? If not what actions has the PPMC taken to
correct this? Has the VP, Brand approved the project name?
