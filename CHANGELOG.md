## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Deletebyquery: Parameter to set the number of rows to fetch from Solr. Speeds up time to gather tiles to delete; especially when there is a lot of them.
- Added Saildrone's `baja_2018` insitu dataset.
- SDAP-454: Added new query parameter `prioritizeDistance` to matchup algorithm
### Changed
- SDAP-443:
  - Replacing DOMS terminology with CDMS terminology:
    - Renaming endpoints:
      - `/domsresults` -> `/cdmsresults`
      - `/domslist` -> `/cdmslist`
    - Removed `/domsvalues` from Swagger UI
  - Swagger UI updates:
    - `platforms` parameter in `/match_spark` is now a multi-select list.
    - Added note to `/stats` endpoint to note it is limited to satellite datasets
- SDAP-450: Updated helm chart to reflect k8s 1.22 changes. Bumped RMQ dependency version & updated Bitnami dependency chart URLs. Ingress template is already up to date.
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Made `platforms` param optional in `/cdmssubset`, and removed int requirement
- Updated OpenAPI specification for `/cdmssubset` to accurately reflect `platforms` and `parameter` field options.
- SDAP-436: Added special case for handling Cassandra SwathMulti tiles with uniform time arrays
- SDAP-449: Fixed `/cdmsresults` NetCDF output displaying and downloading as .txt. 
- SDAP-449: Fixed 404 error when populating datasets; script was still using `/domslist`
- SDAP-415: Fixed bug where mask was incorrectly combined across all variables for multi-variable satellite to satellite matchup
- SDAP-434: Fix for webapp Docker image build failure
- SDAP-412: Explicit definition of `__eq__` and `__hash__` in matchup `DomsPoint` class. This ensures all primary-secondary pairs with the same primary point are merged in the `combineByKey` step.
- SDAP-438: Replace variable value NaN with None to fix error in result storage
- SDAP-444: Fixed `resultSizeLimit` param in `/match_spark` truncating the results that are stored for the results endpoint.
- Fixed null value for count in domslist response
